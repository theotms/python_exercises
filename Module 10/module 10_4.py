# This exercise continues the previous car race exercise from the last exercise set. Write a Race class that has the
# following properties: name, distance in kilometers and a list of cars participating in the race. The class has an
# initializer that receives the name, kilometers, and car list as parameters and sets their values to the
# corresponding properties in the class. The class has the following methods:
# hour_passes, which performs the operations done once per hour in the original exercise: generates a random change
# of speed for each car and calls their drive method. print_status, which prints out the current information of each
# car as a clear, formatted table. race_finished, which returns True if any of the cars has reached the finish line,
# meaning that they have driven the entire distance of the race. Write a main program that creates an 8000-kilometer
# race called Grand Demolition Derby. The new race is given a list of ten cars similarly to the earlier exercise. The
# main program simulates the progressing of the race by calling the hour_passes in a loop, after which it uses the
# race_finished method to check if the race has finished. The current status is printed out using the print_status
# method every ten hours and then once more at the end of the race.
